# Voyage Budgeter 

## Overview

<p>In this application-- developed with Django, Python, and PostgreSQL--you will be able to create short term or long term budgets and plan each trip ahead of time! Not only that but you'll have different ways of knowing how much money you have, how much you've spent, percentages and more.</p>

<p>You will have to be a user to be able to create and view the budgets you've already made, but once you're logged in you'll be able to search through all your budgets and directly add expenses without having to go into the details page of each individual one.</p>

<p>I hope this app is helpful as equally as it was fun for me to produce. Happy budgeting!<p>

## Next Steps

<p>A future step is going to be implementing the ability to have budgets within budgets without limits to how deep you can go within each one.</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to add a feature where you can login with an authenticator such as Google or Facebook.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to include more functionality to the reviews section, so you can add comment in each comment and it have no limit to it as well.</p>
